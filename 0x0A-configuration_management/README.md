Puppet is a configuration management tool used in system administration. It allows administrators to automate the management and configuration of servers, software, and other IT infrastructure. Puppet uses a declarative language to describe the desired system state, which it then enforces by making necessary changes to the system. It's widely used in DevOps practices for its scalability and flexibility.
